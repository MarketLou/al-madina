# Al Madina Website - Recurring Issues and Solutions

## Navbar and Content Spacing

### Issue
The default spacing used for fixed navbars (pt-16 or mt-16) is insufficient for the Al Madina website because of the custom oversized logo.

### Root Cause
- The navbar contains a large logo with classes `h-36 md:h-48` which makes it much taller than standard navbars
- Standard spacing (4rem / 16 tailwind units) doesn't account for this extra height
- This causes content to overlap with the navbar

### Solution
- Use significantly larger padding values on content pages
- Mobile: pt-48 (12rem)
- Desktop: md:pt-56 (14rem)
- Apply this padding to the parent container of page content, not to individual elements

### Example Implementation
```vue
<template>
  <div class="pt-48 md:pt-56">
    <!-- Hero Section or other content -->
    <div>
      <!-- Content here -->
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
```

## Language Toggle Styling

- The language toggle button uses a sliding fill animation with rounded corners (20px radius)
- It maintains a filled state when Arabic is selected
- Uses gray-400 (light) to gray-600 (medium) for English hover state
- Uses gray-800 (dark) for Arabic selected state

## Layout Preferences

- Clean layout with no visual gaps between elements
- Navbar should maintain stable layout during language switches
- Font sizes for navigation items increased by 20% (text-lg)
- Text logo replaced with image logo (public/images/almadina-logo.png)

## Site-wide Styling Requirements

- All new pages must use the background color #FEFAEB (light cream/beige) to maintain visual consistency
- This is the same color used in the navbar (bg-[#FEFAEB])
- Apply this color to content sections using Tailwind classes: bg-[#FEFAEB]
- Hero sections with images can use their own backgrounds, but main content areas should use this color
